# COnA-Project-Group-1_2
Project has two portions: 

# Work assignment:
## NewStudent.c
- Andrew 
-
## DisplayPlot.c
-
-

# Naming Convention 
camelCase for variables, e.g. Red Led Wave Form value: redLedWaveform
PascalCase for functions e.g. Graph Plotting Function: GraphPlot

# DisplayPlot.c
1) Input of wave.txt file
2) Transform binary high low data values into plotted graph
3) Display frequency and duty cycle values of respective LEDs on the graph
4) Display x-axis, time, and y-axis, amplitude, legends 

# Example_wave.txt
PLEASE READ PLEASE 
## Wave Configuration Values
.txt file will contain the frequency and duty cycle values in the first two lines of the file for the red and green light respectively
Red LED is line 1, Green LED is line 2
Format will follow: [wave_number],[frequency_value],[duty_cycle_value]
wave_1,2,40
wave_2,8,50

## Wave Data Points
Data points will be in 1 or 0 to represent the HIGH and LOW state amplitude values 
There are 50 points per second
